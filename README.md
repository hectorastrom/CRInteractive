# CRInteractive Goodbye Page Project

## Description

This is a GitHub Pages project that hosts a thank you and goodbye message from the creators of the now-defunct CRInteractive web application. The website was forced to suspend its services due to a database failure which resulted in loss of significant data that could not be restored.

## CRInteractive YouTube Walkthrough

We also wanted to include a Youtube video walkthrough of how the platform was used. It can be found [here](https://youtu.be/4w8IB8kqKDA).

Dear CRInteractive community,

On January 15th, 2023, users trying to log into their accounts encountered an unexpected error message that blocked access to their accounts. We later found that our database provider had suspended the service that hosts our database. Consequently, all data logged over the past 18 months has been lost and cannot be restored.

Sadly, CRInteractive will also be suspending its service as of today. We are delighted with the personal and community-wide impact the website had during its service, and we want to thank you for joining us on this journey!

All the best,

Albert and Hector Astrom

Creators of CRInteractive, Bleeders of Red
