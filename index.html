                <p>Dear CRInteractive community,</p>
                <p>
                    On January 15th, 2023, users trying to log into their
                    accounts encountered an unexpected error message that
                    blocked access to their accounts. We later found that our
                    database provider had suspended the service that hosts our
                    database. Consequently, all data logged over the past 18
                    months has been lost and cannot be restored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sadly, CRInteractive will also be suspending its service as
                    of today. We are delighted with the personal and
                    community-wide impact the website had during its service,
                    and we want to thank you for joining us on this journey!
                </p>
                <p>All the best,</p>
                <p>
